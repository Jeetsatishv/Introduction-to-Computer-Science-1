For the most part of the article, I am fascinated by Kurzweil ability to predict the future with technology. Technology is getting smarter everyday, and we are continuously making progress in the field of AI. However, his vision of future is something I am not personally looking forward to. I agree it is fascinating that computers will be capable of doing multiple tasks that humans currently do with more efficiency, but at what cost? I am afraid for low level workers who will lose their jobs due to technology taking over. Already at the given moment in time right now, we have labors losing jobs in industry as machines are quickly and easily taking over them. I agree computing and AI might help humans in numerous ways but I think it will cause income distribution to widen. Currently they are teaching computers to process human language in order to perform tasks that would seem impossible and intricate to people of past times. AI is able to make music that is best suited to humans. I wonder if it has the same human touch to it. Kurzweil does talk in brief about the impact on medicine and he states that we could increase human life expectancy, which is great! However will that be affordable?
Kurzweil has made some astonishing predictions, and I do believe them to an extent. One of his predictions that we will have map that can find the shortest route have already come true, and many others. I believe that he thinks using algorithms and human brain, which is all neural networks are about. In Highschool i learned about Djakartas theorem. Which is used to find the shortest route amongst places. Therefore, I believe though hard, it is not impossible to predict the future, especially at time where technology is evolving at a very high rate. In short, I believe his predictions cited in the article.
