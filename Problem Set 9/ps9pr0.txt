Few of the tasks that the pivot search will be helpful with is how doctors interact with it and lawyers. Agrees that doctors can google most things or look back in textbook, but accessing their own memory will allow them to recall their own tips or tricks back in the good ol days that they might have potentially forgot now. I really like the lawyers example as it will give you a more indepth idea about your client’s innocence if they are or guilty if not. It might affect how you lawyer for them if you find out they were wrong and you might be biased, but other than that its a great tool. Furthermore, I personally believe that context is everything. Sometimes we misunderstand people and knowing context would be very beneficial. The imagined applications are very believable and compelling. Infact I have seen something like this similar in “Black Mirror”. However it all comes down to the data this machine will store. Will this store videos? Images? Text? Often for anything legal, this tool could be a great tool to see if someone is being truthful or not. For instance, imagine someone runs a red light, the first thing they probably think is “oh rats I crossed a red light” or if they go above the speed limit. Instead of arguing, the police can just look at their pivot search and try to find that moment. Pivot searching will never result in anything false being stored, if perfected, therefore for anything where truth is very much required, pivot searching would be great.
